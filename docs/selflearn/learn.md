# Self Learning
## Introduction
### What these pages are
- These pages are from when I self-studied OS and Architecture
- They are good for pointing you in the right direction for undergraduate level stuff, but have not been updated to account for any of the knowledge I've picked up during my research time
### What I hope for them to be later
#### State of my current Notes
- I actually keep quite a large private repositiory of research and class notes, though since it's a personal copy I tend to use resources that I would need significant permissions for to share publically
- A portion of my notes I think would be quite useful in sharing information I compiled via going down long rabbit holes, compiled scattered info
- I hope to slowly migrate much of my private repository to my public website

#### The model 
- Yizhou Shan keeps all (?) of his notes on his public website [lastweek.io](http://lastweek.io/)
- while a bit scattered, me and many other systems researchers often come across his notes when googling obscure systems topics
- I'd like my website to become a similar place where people can read about obscure stuff
#### Topic Goals
- Rarely discussed but important to understand hardware, like Intel/AMD on-chip interconnects
- Stuff that is well documented throughout N random paper background sections, but not fully well-documented anywhere 
- Semiconductor topics important for understanding systems
- Anything that I think is interesting
## Advanced resources
### Graduate Systems course Reading Lists
- Most graduate classes just post their reading list online
- These reading lists can present a guided search through otherwise not comprehensively documented topics
- Also they present a great way to get accustumed with the state of the art
#### List
- [Operating Systems in Datacenters](https://amyousterhout.com/cse291-fall23/) (UCSD CSE 291) by Amy Ousterhout
	- Discusses modern OS and datacenter techniques
	- This is a fun class if you ever get a chance to take it :)
- [Graduate OS](https://amyousterhout.com/cse221-fall24/readings.html) (UCSD CSE 221) by Amy Ousterhout
	- A multi-topic class covering many of the big papers in OS
