#Linux
For linux you have to learn by doing. Using linux will give you a big edge up by giving you better access to many development tools for hardware and software.

##Great starting distributions
|Title|Benefits|Based on|
|-----|--------|--------|
|Ubuntu|Popular, easy| Debian|
|Fedora|Good community, also easy| Red Hat|
|Pop OS|Popular, good graphics support| Ubuntu/Debian|

##The terminal
I am a big fan on a simplistic user interface and frequent use of the terminal but I know this is not for everyone. However, this approach will give you a leg up on working in terminal-only environments.

###Learn the terminal via exposure
####Setup
- Install a simple Window Manager like i3
- Install a simplistic terminal based text editor like vim
####Doing
- Do all of your tasks such as file moving, coding, program installation, et cetera from the terminal
- If you get confused google how to do something (also use manpages) 
    
This is how I still go about all of my daily tasks and I find it rather easy. If you know the commands well typing commands can often be easier then a GUI
