## Who am I

Hello! I'm Ryan Kosta, a senior at UC San Diego, studying Computer Science.

I conduct systems research with Associate Professor [Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/) and Assistant Professor [Amy Ousterhout](https://amyousterhout.com/), see [Research](research/research/) page for more information.

I also recently completed a summer research internship at EPFL with Full Professor [Edouard Bugnion](https://people.epfl.ch/edouard.bugnion) (Co-founder of VMware and Nuova systems)

### What I do 

My research interests span Operating Systems, Datacenter Networks, and Computer Architecture.

In my free time I like learning languages, exploring, and occasionally playing guitar or videogames

Always excited to discuss research with those in industry, academia, or who are interested!

Definitely reach out: **rkosta** AT **ucsd.edu**
