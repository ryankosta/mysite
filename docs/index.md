Hello! I'm Ryan Kosta, a junior at UC San Diego, studying Computer Science.

I conduct systems research with Associate Professor [Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/) and Assistant Professor [Amy Ousterhout](https://amyousterhout.com/), see [Research](research/research/) page for more information.

My research interests span Operating Systems, Datacenter Networks, and Computer Architecture.

Always excited to discuss research with those in industry, academia, or who are interested!

Definitely reach out: **rkosta** AT **ucsd.edu**
