#Guitar setup

My silent vintage tube amp setup.

##Guitars

- 1979 Fender Stratocaster (Natural wood)
- 2019 Fender Stratocaster (Black) 
- 1999 Fender Stratocaster (Silverburst)
- Fender Telecaster Deluxe Reissue

##Amps 
- Vox AC15 reissue
- 1980 Fender champ 
- Blues junior special edition
- Fender Super Six head (twin reverb circuit)
 
##Attenuator setup 
I use the Torpedo Captor X (8 ohms) for attenuation and cabinet emulation.

I have it connected to a cheap Neewer mixer board allowing me to use it in stereo (with individual channel control) and mixing in audio for my computer allowing me to play along with Jam Tracks. 

I use a Shiit Modi 2 to connect my computer with the mixer board. I use the mixer headphone out with Sennheiser HD598Cs
